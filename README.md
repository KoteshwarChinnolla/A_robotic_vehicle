# A-algorithm-Autonomous-navigatioon-vehicle-
This project introduces a fresh approach to autonomous vehicle navigation to a required
destination in environments by avoiding the obstacles, utilizing the A* algorithm. By harnessing the
A* algorithm, the vehicle calculates the most efficient route within this binary layout to reach its
target. The algorithm explores the space intelligently, factoring in both the cost of reaching each point
and an estimate of the remaining distance. Using path following functions we allow the vehicle to
follow the path to reach the target

By employing this method, the vehicle can navigate autonomously towards its goal, ensuring
it avoids obstacles and stays on the designated path. This research is a significant step forward in
enhancing autonomous navigation systems, providing a dependable means of finding obstacle-free
paths for a variety of real-world applications.

Moreover, by combining both hardware and advanced algorithms, our system demonstrates
strong obstacle avoidance capabilities while staying true to the intended route. We achieve this using
components like Arduino, a motor shield, and an ultrasonic sensor. In the Arduino code, we use a 2D
array to represent the environment where we implement the A* algorithm. Through path following
functions, we enable the vehicle to navigate along the path to its destination
